                Objects are things in the map where the ghost can interact with, either touching, throwing and even closing doors.<br>

                Cursed Objects are items located at a fixed location in everymap. Their purpose is to make the game<br>
                fun and interesting depends on how you use it. There are a total of 6 different Cursed object in the<br>

                <p>
                    The Cursed Mirror is by far the most useful Cursed Object to find the Ghost room.<br>
                    The Mirror allows the user to see the point of view of the ghost to find the ghost<br>
                    by matching the surrounding appearance in exchange for the player's sanity.<br>
                    When the player's sanity is 0, the mirror will crack and the ghost will start Hunting.<br>

                    Music Box is one of the harder cursed object to use. It is used by playing it and <br>
                    listening to the ghost's singing to find the ghost room. When in used, the ghost will<br>
                    appear and sing while standing still. When placed on the ground <span style ="color: red; font-weight:bold;">NEAR</span> the ghost<br>
                    the ghost will walk close till he touches the music box and start a hunt.<br>

                    The Ouija Board is a item where allows the player to talk and ask the ghost question.<br>
                    The question can be anything and the game makes it so that the ghost will responds to <br>
                    them. Players need to use the in game voice chat to talk to the ghost.<br>
                    While talking to the ghost, you can take a picture of the ghost interacting with the board.<br>
                    It exchanges sanity for answers and breaks when a player is too far from the board without saying goodbye<br>
                    or uses with 0 sanity. This starts a hunt immediately.<br>
