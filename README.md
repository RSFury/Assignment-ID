Phasmophobia Guide website
This is a website about how to play phasmophobia if you feel like playing the game or already playing the game but do not know what the game is about and how to play the game. I have many friedns who plays the game but do not know how items in game works and how thing work. I have made different pages in the website to cater to different needs. Whether it is to know the different nature of ghost, how to use equpiment or even just map awareness.
The aim of this guide is to teach people how to play phasmophobia and teach them how each item works.
