Phasmophobia Guide website

This is a website about how to play phasmophobia if you feel like playing the game or already playing the game but do not know
what the game is about and how to play the game. I have many friedns who plays the game but do not know how items in game works
and how thing work. I have made different pages in the website to cater to different needs. Whether it is to know the different
nature of ghost, how to use equpiment or even just map awareness.

The aim of this guide is to teach people how to play phasmophobia and teach them how each item works.

General Navigation bar is located at the top of every page of the website, it is to nagivate through all the pages created.
The home page is located at the left as for almost all my past experience using websites with navigation bar, the home button 
is always isolated witha different font while all the other content pages are grouped together.

The main page index.html is created with a rough description of why the game was created.
It is created with a download button which redirected the users to the website to buy the game.

The second page Equipment.html is created with the purpose to explain how to use each equipment given in the game.
It is catergorised in two different category. Light pink being the items needed to complete the primary objective of the game,
while blue being the secondary object in the game. I have also added the side navigation with scroll to fast forward to the
specific infomation they want to see instead of slowly scrolling down. Each equipment have their own pictures to further explain
how the item is used and what they need to look out for when using it.

The third page Map.html is a page created to explain the layout of the different maps in the game. It has a rough description 
of the layout of the maps with explanation of all the different symbol seen there.The number of rooms each map have is stated 
there with where the location of certain object is located too. It is categorised in 3 ways, small, medium and 
large maps with their respective colours of green, yellow and red.

The fourth page, my proudest page, is created with the sole purpose of explaining all the different ghost present in the game.
All the name and type of ghost is stated inside with information of what each ghost do specifically that other ghost do not,
and the legend is also clearly separated in colour code in order to show and tell the reader the thigns about the ghost.
It also includes the filter to filter out ghost type that you want to look into for a better user experience, along side the 
side navigation bar for faster navigation.

The fifth page is the page to explain all the objects present in the game. This includes how to know if an object is touched
by the ghost in the area and what are the different objects available in the game. It have detailed description with pictures
to help the reader to further understand what each item does by showing them how to use it, what happen when you use it and
what to look out for.

The sixth and the final page is the page where the user can download an excel sheet where all the information have been gathered
for the user to use in case they have no wifi for the website.

Things I did not include and reason of why:

Video/gif - I did not include videos as I feel like the pictures are more than enough to explain each item. Plus while in game,
players would not have time to refer to the website if the video is included.

Carousel - When the user refers to the website, I want them to have a side by side comparison with the other pictures to spot
the difference so that they would know what the item does more effectively.

More website design - The reason I do not make my website as nice with multiple backgrounds etc is due to it being a website
to guide users on how to play the game. Since the users already have the game, I do not need to create a flashy website to 
encourage them to get the game. It is maily a guide to teach them how to play and I would not like them to be distracted by
the design around it.(I feel like its not a need as I have seen mulitple websites with game guide too)

Note: 
All the pictures I have used are all taken by me so there are no copy rights on it and all the files I have used are made
by me and my friends. So there are no copied item in the website.
